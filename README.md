# Weather-Forecasting-using-real-time-timeseries-data

## About the project:
Weather prediction is one of the most certainly required information in all over the regions
It involves collecting global meteorological surface and upper-air observations, preparing global surface and upper air pressure, temperature, moisture, and wind analyses at frequent time intervals based upon these observations we predict some data for upcoming days weather conditions

## Project Description: 

This data contains day wise weather attributes from 2022 to July 2033 (predicted data)
Columns are as follows :
Date
Average temperature (°F)
Average humidity (%)
Average dewpoint (°F)
Average barometer (in)
Average windspeed (mph)
Average gust speed (mph)
Average direction (°degree)
Rainfall for month (in)
Rainfall for year (in)
Maximum rain per minute
Maximum temperature (°F)
Minimum temperature (°F)
Maximum humidity (%)
Minimum humidity (%)
Maximum pressure
Minimum pressure
Maximum wind speed (mph)
Maximum gust speed (mph)
Maximum heat index (°F)

The Project will consist of 2 modules:
Module 1: Pre-processing, Analysing data using Python and SQL.
Module 2: Visualizing data using Power bi.

## Module 1: Pre-processing, Analysing data using SQL

In this module, you will query the dataset using structured query language to gain insights from the database. The problem statements to be solved will be provided to you and you need to provide the solution for the same using your logic. Different concepts of SQL will be used in this process such as aggregating the data, grouping the data, ordering the data, etc. Module 1 consists of subtasks which are as follows

### Task 1: Pre-processing the data

Data preprocessing is one of the important steps in data analytics because data that is not processed can lead to different unwanted results when the data is used for further applications. This task includes sub-tasks such as handling null values, deleting or transforming irrelevant values, data type transformation, removing duplicates, etc. The tasks to be performed for cleaning the data set are given below:

#### Subtask 1: Correct years for given data set
        
#### Subtask 2: removal of duplicate rows and duplicate Columns

#### Subtask 3: fix a few labels in the given data set 

#### Subtask 4: Encoding data into suitable format

## Module 2: Visualizing data using Power BI.

Here comes the next module. You will use the weather datasets and the data table you created to visualize what the numbers in and behind the data want to convey. You have to create a dashboard for the same using different statistical graphs and diagrams for a visual understanding and analysis. Given below are the requirements, create a dashboard consisting of mentioned visuals.
